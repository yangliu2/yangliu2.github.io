# Neo4j UI

# Two frontend routes
Both the Flask server and JS frontend route can be used to visit. Flask is
easier to add functionalities, since I know python a lot better than javascript.


# Flask server
`bash run.sh` to run the flask server on linux. `index.html` in templates is
the landing page.

# JS frontend
`index.html` in root is the landing page of the JS route. `public/js` are the
javascript files related to that page. 

Both share `public/css/style.css` for styling pages.
