	<h1 align="center"> My Professional Stories </h1>
		<div id="leftcolumn">
			<h2> Technical </h2>
			Statistics – SAS, Hadoop and other big data analysis tools. <br><br>
			Algorithms – Java programming algorithms for faster data processing.

			<h2> Strategic </h2>
			Developed a non-invasive measurement of brain activity for psychophysics evaluation using pupil size.  

			<h2> Innovative </h2>
			Injecting solutions with glass micropipette is challenging due to the small volume (<10 microlitters). So I found a beveled modification of the micropipette tip for proper injection.

			<h2> Risk management </h2>
			Balanced the financial resources needed for a project with great reward by making sure the solution is plausible first. 

			<h2> Champion/Energy </h2>
			Continuously developed the micropipette injecting system despite repeated failures, but eventually successful. 

			<h2> Collaboration </h2>
			Working with a team of electrical engineers, mathematicians, and biologist, I was able to communicate my biological findings to formulate a model for the mathematicians to test and develop a device with the engineers for animal implantation.

			<h2> Enabling </h2>
			As a postdoc, I trained 2 graduate students for performing animal surgeries and brain activity recording. I encouraged them to independently carry out the experiment so they have a much better understanding of our research. 

			<h2> Empathy </h2>
			I was willing to change shifts on weekends with graduate students and technicians so they can see family and be able to take vacations. 

			<h2> Rapport </h2>
			In everyday conversations, I seek people's interests so I could share similar interests in developing a personal relationships with them.

			<h2> Structure </h2>
			As the lab manager, I carefully plan who is doing which experiment and what outcome they have at this moment for maximum production of the lab.    

			<h2> Tactical </h2>
			Replaced a problematic stimulator with an older model that resulted in permanent replacement of the unit. 

			<h2> Control </h2>
			I evaluate the importance of my current work and compare it against other high impact publications and see how important is my work. 

			<h2> Delegation </h2>
			I delegate specific piece of the project to skilled students in that specific area resulted in faster publication time.

		<div id="rightcolumn">
			
			<h2> Production </h2>
			Only used 1/3 of the results from all experiments by comparing to the quality of world class laboratories. 

			<h2> Focused </h2>
			Continuously improved viral vector deliver method until we were able to flawlessly delivered it into a live animal.

			<h2> Competition </h2>
			Even after I learned another lab was working on a similar idea, I was able to find an alternative approach that improve the understanding of the field using methods the other lab does not have. 

			<h2> Technical literacy </h2>
			I volunteered in Brain Fair for young kids and community outreach events for spinal cord injured patients to effectively explained my research. 

			<h2> Style flexibility </h2>
			Be able to explain my research to peer researchers, fund raising staff, spinal cord injured patients and young kids. 

			<h2> Emotional intelligence </h2>
			I’m able to keep cool even when experiments are not working well and when professors challenge my results during thesis defense. 

			<h2> Social intelligence </h2>
			When the administrator conduct personnel reviewed during the 2008 economic crisis, I was able to demonstrate how my research is important in pursuing a cure for spinal cord injury.
